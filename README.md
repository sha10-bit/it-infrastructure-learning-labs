# Week 1 – Windows Server AD & GPO Lab

## Project Overview
This lab demonstrates hands-on experience in setting up an enterprise-style Active Directory environment using VMware. The goal was to implement organizational units (OUs), role-based Group Policy Objects (GPOs), and domain-joined clients to enforce company policies and user permissions.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Virtual Machine Setup
- Created two VMs:
  - Windows Server 2016 (Server)
